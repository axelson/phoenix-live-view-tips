## Why is `mount/3` being called twice?

Straight from [the docs themselves](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/0.12.1/Phoenix.LiveView.html#c:mount/3):

> For each LiveView in the root of a template, mount/3 is invoked twice: once to do the initial page load and again to establish the live socket.

The important phrase here being "the root of the template". In this case:

```elixir
scope "/", AppWeb do
  live "/", PageLive
end
```

`PageLive`'s `mount/3` is called twice on the first navigation to `"/"`. Once you navigate to another `LiveView` with [`live_redirect`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.Helpers.html#live_redirect/2), however, `mount/3` is called once.

Note that if you're performing some expensive operation in `mount/3`, take a look at [`connected?`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/0.12.1/Phoenix.LiveView.html#connected?/1). A check to see if the socket is connected to defer the work is fine when it's needed.

## I'm fetching the `current_user` in `mount` and it's being fetched... twice üò§üò§

Which is expected, see above :D If you are fetching it in a plug you're actually fetching it three times... the horror! To solve this, reach for [`assign_new/3`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/0.12.1/Phoenix.LiveView.html#assign_new/3). This allows you a few niceties such as sharing connection assigns on the initial HTTP request and only setting an assign if it's not available to children components.

This, admittedly, took me a while to wrap my head around. Nothing helps like a (contrived) example!

```elixir
# in a plug or controller
conn
  |> assign(:foo, "BAR")

defmodule AppWeb.PageLive do
  use AppWeb, :live_view

  def render(assigns) do
    ~L"""
      <div>assign foo is <%= @foo %></div>
    """
  end

  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
    {:ok, assign_new(socket, :foo, fn -> "bar" end)}
  end
end
```

Here's the logic of the `:foo` assign:

- On the first disconnected mount, `PageLive` will render `"BAR"` in place of `@foo` because the key is already available in the `conn`
- On the second connected mount, it will render `"bar"` because there are no parent assigns to pull from

Now, let's add and render a stateful `LiveComponent` and see how `assign_new` behaves:

```elixir
# in a plug or controller
conn
  |> assign(:foo, "BAR")

defmodule AppWeb.PageLive do
  use AppWeb, :live_view

  def render(assigns) do
    ~L"""
      <div>assign foo is <%= @foo %></div>
      <%= live_component(@socket, AppWeb.PageLiveChild, id: "page-live-child", bar: @bar) %>
    """
  end

  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
    socket =
      |> assign_new(:foo, fn -> "bar" end)
      |> assign(:bar, "FOO")
    {:ok, socket}
  end
end

defmodule AppWeb.PageLiveChild do
  use Phoenix.LiveComponent

  def render(assigns) do
    ~L"""
      <div>
        <div>assign bar is <%= @bar %></div>
      </div>
    """
  end

  def mount(socket) do
    socket =
      socket
      |> assign_new(:bar, fn -> "wee" end)

    {:ok, socket}
  end
end
```

Let's go through the rendering logic for `PageLiveChild`:

- On the first disconnected mount, `PageLiveChild` will render `"FOO"` in place of `@bar` because the key is already available in socket coming in from the parent, `PageLive`
- On the second connected mount, it will render exactly same thing! That's because `:bar` is still set from the socket assign in `PageLive`

## I want my `LiveView` to be rendered once and only once

Seeing `mount/3` being called on every `live_redirect` but want it to just be called once? Render your component in `root.html.leex` like this:

```elixir
<%= live_render(@conn, AppWeb.PageLive) %>
```

Now `PageLive` will survive redirects.

## I want to upload a file!

File uploads aren't supported by `LiveView` just yet. Check out [Jon Rowe's](https://github.com/JonRowe) library [Phoenix Live View Dropzone](https://github.com/JonRowe/phoenix_live_view_dropzone).

## My form isn't tracking changes! üò†

`LiveView` can't compute diffs instead of anonymous functions, so [`form_for/4`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_html/Phoenix.HTML.Form.html#form_for/4) doesn't work. Make sure you are using [`form_for/3`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_html/Phoenix.HTML.Form.html#form_for/3).

## Nothing is tracking changes!!! üò°üò°üò°

Make sure you're writing code in a `html.leex` file, not `html.eex` üòá

## Is pagination a thing?

Not out of the box, but check out [joshchernoff's](https://gist.github.com/joshchernoff) very helpful [gist](https://gist.github.com/joshchernoff/e8473ed01f31e01a2153c9b621ee529f).

## I'm trying to redirect in a callback but it's being ignored ü§î

Just like [`assign/3`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/0.12.1/Phoenix.LiveView.html#assign/3), [`redirect/2`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/0.12.1/Phoenix.LiveView.html#redirect/2) annotates and _returns_ the updated socket. Meaning, this won't work:

```elixir
def handle_info("annotate_redirect", _, socket) do
  redirect(socket, to: Routes.some_path())
  {:noreply, socket}
end
```

But this will:

```elixir
def handle_info("annotate_redirect", _, socket) do
  socket = redirect(socket, to: Routes.some_path())
  {:noreply, socket}
end
```

Extra credit if you noticed this is also an option:

```elixir
def handle_info("annotate_redirect", _, socket) do
  {:noreply, redirect(socket, to: Routes.some_path())}
end
```

Remember: data is immutable in Elixir!

## No, really, my redirect isn't working in a callback ü§îü§î

Note that [`redirect/2`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/0.12.1/Phoenix.LiveView.html#redirect/2) requires you take action on the provided redirect location. If you want to redirect right from the server, use [`push_patch/2`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/0.12.1/Phoenix.LiveView.html#push_patch/2) or [`push_redirect/2`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/0.12.1/Phoenix.LiveView.html#push_redirect/2).

## Can I style live flash messages?

Absolutely! In a fresh Phoenix app generated with the `--live` flag, you can see this in `templates/layout/live.html.leex`:

```elixir
<p class="alert alert-info" role="alert"
    phx-click="lv:clear-flash"
    phx-value-key="info"><%= live_flash(@flash, :info) %></p>
```

If you'd like to conditionally display it and wrap it in more complicated markup, try:

```elixir
<%= if message = live_flash(@flash, :info) do %>
  <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" phx-click="lv:clear-flash" phx-value-key="info">
    <div class="some-class">
      <div class="another-class">
        <%= message %>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

## But what does my `LiveView` process state _really_ look like?

Check out [toranb's](https://github.com/toranb) quick blog post on [inspecting `LiveView` process state](https://toranbillups.com/blog/archive/2020/05/09/phoenix-liveview-process-state/).

## I'm using `live_action`s and my modules are getting large and unwieldly üôÅ

Instead of separating logic via `live_action`s in the router like this:

```elixir
scope "/", AppWeb do
  live "/", PageLive, :index
  live "/edit", PageLive, :edit
  live "/foo", PageLive, :foo
end
```

Pull them out into separate, name-spaced modules:

```elixir
scope "/", AppWeb do
  live "/", PageLive.Index
  live "/edit", PageLive.Edit
  live "/foo", PageLive.Foo
end
```

## Why can't I send a message to my `LiveComponent` process?

`LiveComponent`s aren't in their own process, only `LiveView`s are. If you call `self()` in a `LiveComponent` you'll get back that `PID` of the `LiveView` parent.

## Why does Phoenix 1.5 generate a `root.html.leex` if it doesn't track changes?

It can be used to track changes later if you want to render a `LiveView` inside of it. Mainly, it's to reduce confusion üòÅ
